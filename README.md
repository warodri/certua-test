# Certua | Angular Techincal Test

## Introduction

The task entails querying a live API of your choice. 

You are required to enhance the project skeleton by querying the API based on user input, display a list of results so that the user can select one. The selection should trigger additional call(s) to display further information.


Notes:
* Results should be displayed in a manner that is presentable and professional.
* Below is a list of APIs available for user-consumption that are easily available for consumption.
* Alongside implementing the requirements above, the finished project should be production-ready. This requires
effective unit-tests to be written for the functionality you have implemented.

## Project

The project is written in Angular 9, with Angular Material installed. Feel free to add any necessary npm packages you
feel necessary to complete the task.

## Setup

1. Run `npm i` (and await the packages to install)
2. Run `ng serve -o`
3. Observe the project starting in a browser.

## Requirements

1. Download the queried data from an API of your choice.
2. Present the data to the user.
3. Style the layout of the data.
4. Test any relevant components/services/pipes you implement.

2. Make the website mobile-responsive so it looks good on mobile.
